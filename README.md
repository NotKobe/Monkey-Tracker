# Monkey-Tracker ðŸ™ˆ

A web application built by Josh Lee, Michael Yu and Alberto Liu to keep track of people who have authentic NFTs and discussions about NFTs on Twitter through the Twitter and OpenSea API.

Users will be able to look at specific blockchains and see what celebrities has purchased NFTs from those blockchains in a compact view, but still offers much information such as
new trends, new blockchains and general news about what is happening in the community.

To use this, please `git clone` on this repo and put it in a location that has node.js installed since this is built using Javascript

Then run npm install -> npm start to start using the app

The **Blockchains** tab will display all of the information about NFT purchases and what's being said about them on Twitter.

The _our engineers_ tab will tell the user a little but about the developers of the app and our personal favorite NFT(s).

All NFTs you see were _brought_ legally and the logo is non-copyrighted, but please credit us if you do use it :)
