# Monkey-Tracker ðŸ™ˆ

A web application built by Josh Lee, Michael Yu and Alberto Liu to keep track of people and discussions about NFTs on Twitter through the Twitter and OpenSea API.

Users will be able to look at specific blockchains and see what celebrities has purchased NFTs from those blockchains in a compact view, but still offers much information such as:
new trends, new blockchains and general news about what is happening in the community.

To use this, please `git clone` on this repo and put it in a location that has node.js installed since this is built using Javascript

Then run `npm install` -> `npm start` to start using the app

And then start learning about what people are saying about NFTs!

All NFTs you see were _brought_ legally and the logo is non-copyrighted, but please credit us if you do use any of our work :)
